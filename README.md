# Awesome-TB

## Introduction

This year, we can try to learn together, share ressources (website, tutorial, 
code sample), and help each other. I hope that we can create something as *awesome*
as this pages : [awesome courses](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses), 
[awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), 
[linux-insides](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides).  

## What we can find here ? 

* Correction of exercices
* Courses notes
* Tutorials and external ressources
* Technology watch

Please, read this [summary](https://github.com/Nairolf21/awesome-TB/blob/master/SUMMARY.md) to find 
what you're loooking for. 

## Why are you doing this ? 

The third and final year at TB isn't really fair. Some of us have made internships last year, others 
were in 2nd year. We have followed different majors and minors courses. So, we don't have the same
knowledge. Some of us are better in C/C++, others are better in Java or Python. Don't you think 
that we can help each other ? Teachers usually do not give any corrections. I think it would be 
great if we use Awesome-TB to share corrections, and our knowledge. 

So, awesome-TB has been created because...

* We do not have corrections
* We do not have the same experience
* It's easier to become better together than alone

## I want to help you, what can I do ? 

Everybody can contribute and improve this project. It's obvious that awesome-TB will be really
awesome only if a lot of students help to build something great ! What can you do to help ? 

* You can improve the english used
* You're an expert in a language ? Help us to learn this language 
* Help us to update and improve corrections of exercices
* Feel free to open [issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) in order to ask 
for something or if you don't understand a source code for example

If you want to contribute, please read the 
[how to contribute](https://github.com/Nairolf21/awesome-TB/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) 
page. 

## Everything is public, it is not risky ? What happens if TB doesn't like this page ? 

There is two different results. Either nobody cares about this page, and nobody wants to be 
involved in this project. If it's the case, nobody will see what I'm doing on Github. I will 
certainly continue to write things I learn on Github, for myself, and school will not care 
so much. Either you are interested by *sharing knowledge* and *help each other*. In this case, 
maybe I will give the project private, or, maybe, we can migrate to another platform, as 
[Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and ask resel to install one instance in servers. 

So, don't worry ;)
