# Awesome-TB

## Introduction

This year, we can try to learn together, share ressources (website, tutorial, 
code sample), and help each other. I hope that we can create something as *awesome*
as this pages : [awesome courses](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses), 
[awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), 
[linux-insides](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides).  

Everybody can contribute and improve this project. If you want to contribute, please
read the [CONTRIBUGING.md](https://github.com/Nairolf21/awesome-TB/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) 
file. 

## What we can find here ? 

* Correction of exercices
* Courses notes
* Tutorials and external ressources
* Technology watch

Please, read this [summary](https://github.com/Nairolf21/awesome-TB/blob/master/SUMMARY.md) to find 
what you're loooking for. 

## Why are you doing this ? 

The third and final year at TB isn't really fair. Some of us have made internships last year, others 
were in 2nd year. We have followed different majors and minors courses. So, we don't have the same
knowledge. Some of us are better in C/C++, others are better in Java or Python. Don't you think 
that we can help each other ? Teachers usually do not give any corrections. I think it would be 
great if we use Awesome-TB to share corrections, and our knowledge. 

So, awesome-TB has been created because...

* We do not have corrections
* We do not have the same experience
* It's easier to become better together than alone
